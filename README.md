# i am playlist - My Discover Weekly

## Discover Weekly

Discover Weekly is a playlist published to every user by Spotify that analyses your listening patterns to serve up content that they think you might like. The playlist gets refreshed every week so if you haven't saved the songs you are interested in into a new playlist, then you will lose them forever. My Discover Weekly logs you into your Spotify account, shows you your Discover Weekly recommendations and lets you easily save them into a new playlist which will appear in your account.

## Workflow

* User login with spotify to get access token
* GET list of user's playlists
* Look for a playlist with owner ID 'spotifydiscover' - take its playlist_id
* Look for a playlist with name 'My Discover Weekly Picks' - take its playlist_id
* GET the list of tracks using the spotifydiscover-playlist_id
* Strip the 'spotify track URIs' off the track objects and turn into an comma-separated string
* Did the user have a playlist called 'My Discover Weekly Picks'?
* If yes, POST create a playlist with name 'My Discover Weekly Picks'
* Use the 'spotify track URIs' string to add these songs to the playlist called 'My Discover Weekly Picks'
